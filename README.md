## Develop for the application
The frontend and backend can be worked on as separate projects. Simply clone the project and open the desired portion(backend or frontend) in your editor. With your terminal navigate into the frontend and run:
```
npm install
```
to install all packages. To run the frontend for developing we use the following command in the terminal:
```
npm run serve
```


For the backend we just have to open it as a maven project and after that we can run it.
